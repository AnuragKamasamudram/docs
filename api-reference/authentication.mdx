To interact with Databraid's API, you need to authenticate using API keys. There are two types of API keys: **staging** and **production**.

## Staging Environment

1. **Obtain a Staging API Key**: 
   - You will need a staging API key to test and interact with Databraid's API in a non-production environment.
   - This key is sufficient for development and testing purposes.

## Production Environment

1. **Obtain a Production API Key**:
   - For production use, you must acquire a production API key.
   - This key is necessary for accessing Databraid's API in a live environment.

2. **Add Broker Credentials to AWS Secrets Manager**:
   - In addition to the production API key, you need to add broker credentials to an AWS Secrets Manager.
   - Databraid will have programmatic read-only access to these credentials, ensuring secure and efficient authentication.

### Steps to Authenticate

1. **Request API Key**:
   - Contact your Databraid administrator or support to request the necessary API key for your environment.

2. **Configure AWS Secrets Manager** (for production):
   - Follow AWS documentation to securely store your broker credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.
   - Ensure that Databraid has the necessary permissions to access these secrets.

3. **Use the API Key**:
   - Include the API key in your API requests to authenticate and interact with Databraid's services.

By following these steps, you can securely authenticate and interact with Databraid's API in both staging and production environments.
