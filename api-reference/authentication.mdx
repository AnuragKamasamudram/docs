## API Key Authentication

DataBraid's API uses API keys for secure authentication. Here's how to implement it:

## API Key Usage

The most secure and recommended method is to include the API key in the request headers. Specifically, you should use the "Authorization" header with "X-API-Key".

### Header Format

Authorization: X-API-Key YOUR_API_KEY
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the actual API key provided by DataBraid

## Implementation Example

When making requests to DataBraid's API, ensure you include the API key in your request headers. Here's a simple example using JavaScript's fetch API:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.production.databraid.io', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Security Considerations

- We support HTTPS requests only, ensuring that your requests are securely encrypted during transit. HTTP requests are not supported to maintain the highest level of security.
- Keep your API key confidential and never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
- If possible, make API requests on the server side to avoid exposing your API key in the browser.

By following these guidelines, you can securely authenticate and interact with DataBraid's API using API keys.
