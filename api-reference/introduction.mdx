Welcome to the Databraid API documentation!

Databraid's API is designed to streamline broker servicing of policies without requiring brokers to log in to carrier portals and key-in data. Databraid's infrastructure abstracts the complexity of data transfer between brokers and carriers. The API currently generates quotes for the following policy inquiries:
1. **Add Driver**
2. **Add Vehicle**
3. **Swap Vehicle**
