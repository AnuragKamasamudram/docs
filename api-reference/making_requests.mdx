To interact with DataBraid's API, you'll need to use your staging API key. This key is crucial for request authentication and must be included in the authorization header of every request.

## Your First Request

You can make requests directly from DataBraid's documentation. We support requests in various programming languages:

- cURL
- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Go
- Java

This allows you to experiment with the API and understand its functionality before integrating it into your application.

Follow these steps to make your first API call:

1. Authorization
   - Navigate to the "Get Carriers" endpoint in the DataBraid documentation.
   - In the Authorization header, enter your staging API key:
```
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
2. Specify Parameters
- Fill in all required fields as specified in the API documentation.
- Include optional fields if relevant to your request.

3. Send the Request
- Click the "Send" button to make the request.

## Understanding the Response

The "Get Carriers" endpoint returns a list of carrier connections supported for your brokerage. The response will include carrier IDs, which you can use in subsequent requests.

### Example Response:

```json
{
    "first": 123,
    "offset": 123,
    "has_next_page": true,
    "has_previous_page": true,
    "total_count": 123,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 82343,
            "name": "ABC Insurance Carrier"
        },
        {
            "id": 12893,
            "name": "XYZ Insurance Carrier"
        }
    ]
}
```
Use the carrier IDs for other operations such as:

- Add Vehicle
- Add Driver
- Swap Vehicle

Always handle the response appropriately, checking for errors and extracting required data for further operations.
