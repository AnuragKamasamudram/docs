# Making Requests

To interact with DataBraid's API, you'll need to use your staging API key. This key is crucial for request authentication and must be included in the authorization header of every request.

## Your First Request

Follow these steps to make your first API call:

### Authorization

Navigate to the "Get Carriers" endpoint in the DataBraid documentation.
In the Authorization header, enter your staging API key
text
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY
2. Specify Parameters
1. Fill in all required fields as specified in the API documentation.
2. Include optional fields if relevant to your request.
3. Send the Request
Click the "Send" button to execute the request.

## Understanding the Response

The "Get Carriers" endpoint returns a list of carrier connections supported for your brokerage. The response will include carrier IDs, which you can use in subsequent requests.

### Example Response:json
{
  "carriers": [
    {
      "id": "carr_123456",
      "name": "ABC Insurance",
      "supported_operations": ["add_vehicle", "add_driver", "swap_vehicle"]
    },
    {
      "id": "carr_789012",
      "name": "XYZ Assurance",
      "supported_operations": ["add_vehicle", "add_driver"]
    }
  ]
}
Use the carrier IDs for other operations such as:

- Add Vehicle
- Add Driver
- Swap Vehicle

Always handle the response appropriately, checking for errors and extracting required data for further operations.

## Testing the API

You can test the APIs directly within the DataBraid documentation interface. We support requests in various programming languages:

- cURL
- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Go
- Java

This allows you to experiment with the API and understand its functionality before integrating it into your application.

### Example: Python Request
python
import requests

url = "https://api.databraid.com/v1/carriers"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
Remember to replace YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY with your actual staging API key when making requests.
