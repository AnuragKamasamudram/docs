To interact with Databraid's API, you will need to use your staging API key. This key is essential for authenticating your requests and should be included in the authorization header of each request.

## Making your first request

### Step 1: Authorization
- Navigate to the "Get Carriers" endpoint in Databraid's documentation.
- In the Authorization header, enter your staging API key. This key is required to authenticate your request.

### Step 2: Specify Fields
- Fill in any other required fields as specified in the API documentation.
- You may also include optional fields if they are relevant to your request.

### Step 3: Send the Request
- Once all necessary fields are filled, click the "Send" button to execute the request.

## Response
The "Get Carriers" endpoint will return a list of all carrier connections supported for your brokerage. You can use the IDs of the carriers returned for subsequent HTTP POST requests, such as:
- Add Vehicle
- Add Driver
- Swap Vehicle

Ensure that you handle the response appropriately, checking for any errors or required data for further operations.

## Testing the APIs

You can test the APIs directly within the Databraid documentation and see the responses in real-time. We support requests from various programming languages, including:

- cURL
- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP

This allows you to quickly experiment with the API and understand how it works before integrating it into your application.
